I am a network and application security researcher and practitioner from New Delhi, India. I am currently employed as a security technologist with Infosec Clinic in New Delhi, India.

My blog is centered primarily around network and application security and consumer privacy. My writing has previously featured in publications such as [The Wire](https://thewire.in/author/karan-saini) and [2600 Magazine](https://store.2600.com/products/spring-2018), and some of my work has been documented in publications such as the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/opinion/india-data-privacy-biometric-aadhar.html) and [Caravan Magazine](https://caravanmagazine.in/science-technology/aadhaar-security-failure-government-webpages-provide-unsecured-access-to-demographic-authentication).
